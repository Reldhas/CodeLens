# TA screens

The TA side of the prototype, with made-up sample data and no backend. TA actions
are saved in this browser's localStorage, so run a student-and-TA demo in one
browser. Use the Student / TA switch on the home screen to change views. It also
appears on the TA screens, but not inside exercises. The TA screens appear as tabs
in the header, in the order of the TA's work: Content Studio, Review Queue, Class
Insights.

## Content Studio

One page in four numbered steps, so the logic is clear: the AI writes exercises
from the course material, and students only get what the TA approves and publishes.

1. **Upload course materials:** keeps the file name, week and topic. The file
   itself isn't stored.
2. **Generate exercises with AI:** choose an exercise type and topic. It shows which
   materials it is based on, then reveals pre-made samples after a short wait.
3. **Review and approve:** approved examples per type (3 needed), and each sample
   can be approved, regenerated or rejected.
4. **Publish topics:** which topics students can get.

The number of examples required stays at 3; it has no setting on screen.

These settings really change what students get:

- A function with too few approved examples shows "Your TA is preparing this".
  This applies to all three functions.
- Students only get approved exercises. Rejected, pending and never-generated
  ones are never picked, even while the type stays open.
- Published topics limit Dry Run and Concept Match. Lens Review keeps its own
  topics.

Generation is simulated: the samples are written in advance.

## Review Queue

Lists Lens Review submissions: this browser's real ones plus sample students.
Waiting items come first, then those with more flags, then the newest.

- **Flags:** low AI confidence, student 👎 and watching.
- **Opening one:** the code, the student's comments, the AI draft and the answer key.
- **Actions:** rate the AI feedback, edit its summary, adjust the score, comment,
  Approve and send, Skip, and Watch the student.

The student then gets a notice on the home screen, opening a page with the score,
summary and TA comments. An adjusted score also changes the Skill Map, when that
screen is merged. The latest send wins: setting the score or summary back to the
AI's version after an earlier edit shows the AI's version again.

## Class Insights

Students active, attempts, share started from the Skill Map, students to support,
class averages by function and lens, common gaps, and AI feedback quality. It
combines a made-up class of eight (`sample-class.js`) with this browser's attempts.

## Files

| Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `features/content-studio/` | Content Studio and its pre-made samples |
| `features/review-queue/` | Queue rules, sample submissions and the review screen |
| `features/ta-feedback/` | The notice and page students see |
| `features/class-insights/` | Calculations, sample class and the screen |
| `tests/ta-screens.test.mjs` | Tests |

This pull request only adds new files. The switch and TA menu already exist in
`Shell.tsx` and appear once these features are present.
